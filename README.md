# Chef Claude
Chef Claude is a dynamic web app that takes ingredients from the user and generates recipes - powered by the ClaudeAPI. 
 
 ## Professional Growth:
 * Built controlled forms to capture and manage user input
 * Changed and updated state within components
 * Used the useState React hook to manage component state. 
 * Learned methods of communicating state between components:
    - Why to avoid using derived local state in components and solely handle states in parent components.
 * Learned how to render content dynamically based on user specific criteria (conditional rendering).
 * Use of the React Markdown package to automatically render the response from Claude as markdown instead of plaintext.
